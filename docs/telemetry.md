# Telemetry

To help us improve Slashbase, we collect some anonymous usage data.

Slashbase sends a ping every time app is opened to our analytics service with anonymous data (see below). This helps us know the number of users per version. No end-user data or data from data sources is captured by Slashbase.

To disable telemetry, follow the steps below:
1. Click on setting in top-right corner.
2. Click on Advanced in sidebar menu.
3. Click on No button in telemetry section.

> If you disable telemetry and receive any errors or issues, we request you to please file them in Github Issues.
